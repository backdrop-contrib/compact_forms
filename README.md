Compact Forms
=============

Compact Forms presents text fields for selected forms in a more compact fashion
using jQuery.

The form item/element fields are overlaid with their respective labels. When the
user focuses a field the label fades away nicely, and if the field is left empty
the label fades back in again.

By default, only the user login block is switched to compact style, but the
behavior can be added to any form by adding the corresponding CSS IDs to the
Compact Forms configuration.

- Degrades back to the original form when JavaScript is switched off.
- Fields like checkboxes are currently not affected.
- Inspired by [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/makingcompactformsmoreaccessible)
